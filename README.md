This is Tim's first HTML & CSS Project with The Odin Project.

I've reviewed the Git workflow again through this previous project: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/practicing-git-basics

Project: HTML/CSS link

## Introduction:
For this mini-project, you’ll deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it. Don’t worry if the links don’t go anywhere and the search box doesn’t do anything when you submit it. The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned. For some of you, this may be the first time you’ve actually tried to “build” something in HTML (very exciting!).

Using the browser’s developer tools (right clicking something on the page and clicking “inspect element” will get you there) will be your best friend. Build the page in a .html text file and open it in your browser to check it out (or try using CodePen or jsfiddle.net).
