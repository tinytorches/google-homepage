This is Tim's first HTML & CSS Project with The Odin Project.

I've reviewed the Git workflow again through this previous project: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/practicing-git-basics

Project: HTML/CSS link
https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css

## Introduction:

For this mini-project, you’ll deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it. Don’t worry if the links don’t go anywhere and the search box doesn’t do anything when you submit it. The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned. For some of you, this may be the first time you’ve actually tried to “build” something in HTML (very exciting!).

Using the browser’s developer tools (right clicking something on the page and clicking “inspect element” will get you there) will be your best friend. Build the page in a .html text file and open it in your browser to check it out (or try using CodePen or jsfiddle.net).

## Self-Reflection:

I finally got to tackle my first HTML/CSS project/exercise with the skills I've learned through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and the material on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). I also adapted things I've learned through [Dev Ed's channel on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q).

I also used the DevTools within my browser, which helped a lot. Some of the naming threw me off in the beginning, but the structure of the HTML was making more sense as I looked at it longer along with the CSS to make my code look similar too.

I made multiple attempts at creating index.html and style.css files. The documents named "-archive" were the last version of that respective document. However, I did notice that this helped build more familiarity with the code compared to the first time I tried taking on this project and each attempt was faster, since it was fresh on my mind.

Looking forward to the next lessons that are coming up!
